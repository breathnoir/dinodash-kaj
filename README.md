# Dino Dash


KAJ course semestral project on FEL CTU.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of "Dino Dash" is to create a browser-based game that is inspired by the classic "Chrome Dinosaur" game.
"Dino Dash" aims to enhance user engagement by offering additional features such as character selection, different game palettes, and background music.

## Functionality

* User Interaction: Players can choose their character, and select a color palette and start the game through a simple and intuitive interface within the single-page application.
* Main Game Mechanics: JavaScript is used to handle game dynamics such as character movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
* Service Worker Implementation: To enable offline functionality, a service worker caches all necessary assets, allowing the game to load without an internet connection.
